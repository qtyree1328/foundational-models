**Key Insight:** *"FMs offer a promising pathway forward by learning generalizable feature representations from large-scale unlabeled data... supporting a scalable AI infrastructure for Earth monitoring, forecasting, and decision-making"*

### **Scaling Laws for GFMs: PhilEO Bench Study (January 2026)**
**Paper:** "Scaling Laws for Geospatial Foundation Models" `arXiv:2506.14765`
**Authors:** Nikolaos Dionelis et al.

**Massive Scale Training Experiments:**
- **PhilEO Globe:** 0.5TB (small-scale)
- **FastTOM:** 2TB (medium-scale, newly introduced)
- **MajorTOM:** 23TB (large-scale)

**Architecture Performance Insights:**
- **CNN-based models (Geo-Aware U-Net):** Remain highly competitive in low-shot settings; 200M parameter model outperforms larger architectures on regression tasks
- **ViT-UPerNet (Transformer):** Achieves best performance when scaling to multi-terabyte datasets, particularly for semantic segmentation on 23TB MajorTOM
- **Mamba (State-Space Models):** Show efficiency advantages but require further large-scale pretraining to match CNNs/ViTs

**Critical Finding:** Dataset size matters more than architecture for downstream performance at scale. 23TB training enables substantial improvement over smaller datasets across all architectures.

- **Key Finding:** Current LEOMs show significant vulnerability to real-world corruptions

**Implications for Production Deployment:**
- LEOMs need robustness improvements before operational use
- Weather and sensor-specific training crucial for reliable performance
- Gap between research benchmarks and real-world reliability

### **Remote Sensing Foundation Models Survey (June 2025)**
**Paper:** "Foundation Models for Remote Sensing and Earth Observation: A Survey" `arXiv:2410.16602`
**Authors:** Aoran Xiao et al.
